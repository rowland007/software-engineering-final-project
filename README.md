#About:

This is the Final Project for American Sentinel University's CS221 Software Engineering course. Throughout the course I learned principles of software engineering in medium- and large-scale projects. Explored many of the techniques used to maintain quality in software development, from creating good specifications to testing software modules. For this project I will implement a solution for the Global Tech Industries problem in C++. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
#Goal:

The goal of this project is to both create a good solution and to employ as many sound practices learned in the course as possible.  I will choose a combination of program features and software engineering practices.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
#Scoring:

###Design
(10) Provide a UML class diagram that includes all the classes in this project (you may want to do additional research on the Web to get all the representation information). 

(10) Within the restrictions of a text-based system, provide an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.  Include in your Word document a short explanation of your design choices.

###Implementation
(5) A naming model is adopted and employed for every programmer-named file.

(5) A reasonable comment style is specified and consistently followed.

###Coding/Feature Inclusion
(15) System allows regular employees, secure employees, support employees, and clients to be entered into the system, retrieved individually by employee or client number, and displayed in bulk.

(15) Internally, employees and clients are objects; clients and employees inherit from an abstract base person class; specialized employees inherit from the base employee type.

(5) Employees and clients are stored in a structure without a built-in maximum size (e.g., a linked list and not an array).

(10) System assigns employees to divisions and can list all employees in a particular division, and the division supervisor.

(5) User can designate and display employee's hiring level (e.g., provisional).

###Testing
(5) Provide documentation of basic pass/fail testing for all modules.  Specific methodology is up to you, and can be done with or without including the unit testing technique.

(10) Find a fellow programmer (not another student taking this course!) who will review your code and document the results.

###Tracking
(5) Use the tracking spreadsheet you created in a previous assignment to track the amount of time you spend on this project, and compare this to your estimate.
